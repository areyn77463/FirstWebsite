# FirstWebsite
A website based on a fictional organization using HTML/CSS, PHP, Javascript, SQLite3
This website based on a fictional organization allows you to create a log-in and password, and create an event that will be displayed in an events page. It also contains pages that only logged in users can see.

During this project I learned the basics of HTML/CSS including, links, forms, images, backgrounds, text font/color, margins, padding, etc. I also learned basic php including how to do form checks, use sessions, use password hashing, input form data into a database, and how to pull and output data from a database. This project also required the use of some Javascript to have pop-up error messages and picture slideshows. Lastly, I learned to create and use a database with sqlite3.
